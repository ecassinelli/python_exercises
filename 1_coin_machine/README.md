# 1. Coin Machine Program

## Description

The program must determine the amount of change that would be returned by a coin machine given the amount of money dropped into the machine by a customer (call it the cash) and the cost of the item wanted by the customer (call it the price). Assume that the change will be composed of toonies, loonies, quarters, dimes, and nickels. 

Assume also that:

    • The amount of money dropped into the machine by the customer will always be
    equal to or greater than the cost of the item.
    
    • Amounts are considered to be integer amounts in cents. For example, $2.75 is
    represented by the integer 275.
    
    • Amounts will always be multiples of 5 (i.e. pennies are not considered).
    
    • Your coin machine has an infinite number of each type of coin with which to
    supply change.

Note that, to be considered correct, your program must provide the user with the most convenient exact change (i.e. the exact amount with the fewest coins).

NOTE: Toonie = $2, Loonie = $1, Quarter = 25 ¢, Dime = 10 ¢, Nickel = 5 ¢.

## Task

Write python code that will output the following information:

    1. The amount received by the coin machine.
    2. The cost of the item
    3. The required change
    4. How many of each of the coins will be returned by the coin machine.
